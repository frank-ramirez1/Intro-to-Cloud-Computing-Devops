# Could Architecture

## AWS Well-Architected Framework
### - A guide for designing infrastructures that are secure, high-performing, resilient, efficient
### - A consistent approach to evaluating and implementing cloud architecture
### - A way to provide best practices that were developed through lessons learned by reviewing customer architectures 

## Cloud architects engage with decision makers to identify the business goal

## Pillars of the AWS well-architected framework
### - Operational excellence
### - Security
### - Reliability
### - Performance efficiency
### - Cost optimization

## Operational Excellence Pillar
### - Run and monitor systems to deliver business value, and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures

## Principles of O.E.
### - Perform operations as code
### - Annotate documentation
### - Make frequent, small, reversible changes
### - Refine operations procedures frequently
### - Anticipate failure
### - Learn from all operational events and failures

## Security Pillar
### - protect information systems and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies 

## Principles of Security 
### - implement a strong identity foundation 
### - Enable traceability
### - Apply security at all layers
### - Automate security best practices
### - Protect data in transit and at rest
### - Keep people away from data
### - Prepare for security events

## Reliability Pillar
### - prevent and quickly recover from failures to meet business and customer demand

## Principles of Reliability
### - Test recovery procedures
### - Automatically recover from failure
### - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability 
### - Spot guessing capacity
### - Manage change in automation

## Performance Efficiency Pillar
### - use IT and computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve

## Principles of Performance efficiency
### - Democratize advanced technologies
### - Go global in minutes
### - Use serverless architectures
### - Experiment more often
### - Have mechanical sympathy

## Cost Optimization Pillar
### - run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point

## Principles of cost optimization
### - adopt a consumption model
### - Measure overall efficiency
### - Stop spending money on data center operations
### - Analyze and attribute expenditure
### - Use managed and application-level services to reduce cost of ownership

## Reliability and availability 

## Reliability - a measure of your systemâ€™s ability to provide functionality when desired by the user

## Availability - the percentage of time a system is operating normally 

## A highly available system can withstand some measure of degradation while still remaining available 

## Factors that influence availability 
### - fault tolerance 
### - Scalability 
### - Recoverability

## AWS Trusted Advisor

### - online tool that provides real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best Practices 
### - Looks at your entire AWS environment and gives you real-time recommendations in five categories 
  #### - cost optimization 
  #### - Performance
  #### - Security 
  #### - Fault tolerance
  #### - Service limits
